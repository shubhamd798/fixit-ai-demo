You are an expert DevOps engineer and senior Python developer.

Below is a CI/CD failure log followed by a code snippet.
Your task is to identify the root cause of the failure and provide a minimal fix.

---

ðŸ“Œ Example:
Error log: NameError: name 'math' is not defined

Code:
def area(r):
    return math.pi * r ** 2

âœ… Fix:
import math

def area(r):
    return math.pi * r ** 2

---

Now fix the following issue:

--- ERROR LOG ---
{error_log}

--- CODE CONTEXT ---
Filename: {code_context['file']}
Line: {code_context['line']}
Code:
{code_context['snippet']}

---

âœ… Do not rename or delete functions.
âœ… Fix only the part of the code causing the failure.
âœ… Return only the fixed Python code block. No explanation.
